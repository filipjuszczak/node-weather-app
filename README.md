# A Node.js weather app.

A very simple Node.js/Express app. I coded it as a learning project.

**Description:**

- user provides a city name to look weather for,
- app fetches two different APIs (list below) to get necessary data:
  - weatherstack.com,
  - mapbox.com,
- a handful of interesting information is displayed on the page.
